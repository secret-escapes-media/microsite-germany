      <p class="text--lg">Christmas trees and Christmas markets, advent wreaths and glühwein – it all started in Germany. Most of the traditions we faithfully follow each year have their roots in this country, so where better to spend Christmas? Feast on iconic treats like lebkuchen and stollen and discover those traditions that didn’t quite make it out of the country; for example, Nikolaustag on the 6th of December sees children across Germany waking to find the boot or shoe they left out the night before filled with sweet treats!

      <p class="text--lg">The Germans are masters at deliciously rich and irresistible Christmas feasting. Try festive classics like stollen, first baked in Dresden in the 14th century, washed down with iconic winter-warmer glühwein. Pick from an assortment of sweet treats like Aachen’s classic Printen biscuits or Dominosteine. On Christmas Eve, families get together to exchange presents followed by a traditional German Christmas dinner featuring duck, goose or rabbit – served with red cabbage or potato dumplings for a truly rich treat. Don’t miss the heady Feurerzangenbowle, a strong punch perfect for long winter nights.</p>
