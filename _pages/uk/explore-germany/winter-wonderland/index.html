    highlights:

        content: It doesn’t really get more magical than Neuschwanstein Castle. Mad King Ludwig II built this fairytale wonder in a romantic Gothic style, relying on a set designer rather than an architect. His folly was inspired by Germanic myths and legends and stands as a powerful symbol of his eccentricities. Hike up the hill to the Marienbrücke for a truly spectacular view of the castle and landscape, and be sure to book well ahead if you visit the beguiling castle interiors.

      - id: bamberg
        title: Bamberg
        content: This UNESCO World Heritage town is a charming warren of German medieval architecture, lifted straight from the pages of Grimm’s fairy tales. The Altstadt is awash with half-timbered, crooked and colourful buildings hiding brewhouses and hearty plates of winter-warmers in traditional Wirtshäuser. Bamberg is cosy, old-worldly and effortlessly beautiful.

      - id: trier
        title: Trier
        content: The oldest city in Germany is filled with UNESCO sites, from ancient Roman bath complexes and vast Gothic churches. Set on the banks of the Mosel and surrounded by vine-clad hills, the old town is a heady mix of histories, with Roman relics galore (impressively preserved) rubbing shoulders with medieval masterpieces. Highlights include the vast Roman gate, the Porta Nigra, and the Gothic sprawl of Germany’s oldest cathedral.

    highlights:

      - id: berlins-museum-island
        title: Berlin’s Museum Island
        content: Where else can you walk through an ancient Babylonian gate before gazing at the foreboding landscapes of Romanticist Caspar David Friedrich? Berlin’s Museuminsel is a veritable treasure trove of fine art and ancient wonders. Visit the famous Pergamon Museum and marvel at a full-scale Roman market gate and enchanting Ishtar gate, discover Nefertiti’s iconic bust in the Neues Museum, or discover 19th-century European masters at the Alte Nationalgalerie.

      - id: munichs-high-art
        title: Munich’s High Art
        content: Explore the three art institutions, the Pinakotheke; from old, to new, to modern. The Alte Pinakothek is not just one of Europe’s oldest galleries but also curates one of the finest collection of European Masters from the 14th to the 18th centuries, with the new and modern Pinakotheke covering modern and contemporary pieces. The Haus der Kunst turns its fascist roots on its head by showcasing only ‘degenerate art’, whereas the Lenbachhaus is a showpiece for Munich’s groundbreaking Modernist group ‘Der Blaue Reiter’, with members like Kandinsky and Paul Klee represented.

      - id: hamburgs-art-mile
        title: Hamburg’s Art Mile
        content: Five renowned art galleries occupy a mile-long strip of buzzing Hamburg – the Art Mile. The Deichtorhallen, an old market space that now hosts photography and modern art, is the largest of its kind in Europe. Next door, however, is the largest art museum in Germany – the Kunsthalle. Beyond these, there are another three remarkable stops showcasing applied arts, exhibits focussing on socially-pertinent themes, and grand old masters of European art.



  - id: catch-a-show
    title: Catch a show
    content: Nothing promises to warm you up as much as a show. Germany takes to the stage across the country, with hundreds of theatres and venues set to throw you out of your winter slumber...

    highlights:

      - id: opera
        title: Opera
        content: The Margravial Opera House in Bayreuth is quite possibly the most spectacular of its kind anywhere in the world. The auditorium is a dizzyingly beautiful and intricate example of fine Baroque design – if not excess – setting a gloriously grand tone for a night of opera; be warned though, the captivating interior makes it rather hard to focus on the main event.

      - id: live-music
        title: Live Music
        content: On a cold winter’s day, warm the soul in one of Berlin’s toasty jazz bars. Charlottenburg is the stomping ground, with stalwarts like Quasimodo – first opened in the ‘20s with luminaries like Chet Baker gracing the stage – and A-Trane, a former supermarket which won the title of best jazz club in Germany in 2011.

      - id: musicals
        title: Musicals
        content: Hamburg is Germany’s home of musicals, with an impressive roster of shows taking to the stages of 45 theatres across the city. The Theater im Hafen is possibly the most ‘Hamburg’ of the lot, located in the industrial harbour and best reached for a matinee or evening show by boat; currently showing The Lion King.
