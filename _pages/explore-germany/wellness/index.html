  <p class="text--lg">Spas are a German institution. They’re a cultural stalwart, with a heritage reaching back to the Romans. Whole towns are dedicated to the art, the most famous being Baden Baden – the premodifier Bad, like Bad Sulza, is a dead giveaway for a spa town – and each are typically grandiose affairs steeped in aristocratic pasts where exclusivity was the order of the day. Not true now; in fact, these institutions are so lauded that a visit is even possible through the healthcare system, if you can convince the doctor of your ailments. Though they are now open to everyone, the whole experience is still taken very seriously. It’s worth knowing all the different types too; Kneipp spas, mineral spas, marsh spas, sea spas and salt-water spas, each with their own methods and treatments. All seriousness aside, total relaxation, rejuvenation, and some cheek-reddening nudity are guaranteed. Here’s a round-up of our favourite spas for a truly indulgent winter in Germany.</p>
