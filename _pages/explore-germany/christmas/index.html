      <p class="text--lg">Christmas trees and Christmas markets, advent wreaths and glühwein – it all started in Germany. Most of the traditions we faithfully follow each year have their roots in this country, so where better to spend Christmas? Feast on iconic treats like lebkuchen and stollen and discover those traditions that didn’t quite make it out of the country; example? Krampus. Santa’s evil alter ego terrorises towns on December 6th – make sure you’ve been good! </p>

      <p class="text--lg">The Germans are masters at deliciously rich and irresistible Christmas feasting. Try festive classics like stollen, first baked in Dresden in the 14th century, washed down with iconic winter-warmer glühwein. Pick from an assortment of sweet treats like Aachen’s classic Printen biscuits or Dominosteinen. Christmas Eve offers fish or wurst and goose decks the table on the 25th. Don’t miss the heady Feurerzangenbowle, a strong punch perfect for long winter nights.</p>
