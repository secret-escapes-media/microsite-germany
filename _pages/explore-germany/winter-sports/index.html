      <p class="">Climb Germany’s highest peak – or rather, brave the incomprehensibly-long cable-car to the summit, whilst soaking up some of the finest mountain panorama Germany has to offer. If the day is clear, you can peer into four countries, across snow-capped peaks that fall away from this Bavarian monolith. Pistes trail the slopes, offering superlative skiing. Beyond Zugspitze, the Bavarian Prealps are renowned for ski-touring. A renowned network of routes offers a glorious setting for sliding across this remarkable landscape, with some tours lasting days – a great way to see hidden corners of this region.</p>

      <p class="">This beautiful region, though part of the Bavarian range of the Alps, couldn’t be further culturally from its neighbours. The dialect and food are noticeably different, making for a diverse getaway in Germany’s south. Around the car-free resort of Oberstdorf, you’ll find the highest slopes in the region, stretching 30km with a guarantee of snow. Nearby Mount Nebelhorn offers exhilarating slopes, with Mount Fellhorn not far behind. Back at base camp, the après-ski in Oberstdorf is plentiful; a vibrant collection for memorable evenings. Bad Hindelang is a quieter, more peaceful option great for families. Here the slopes aren’t as steep and the cross-country skiing trails are plentiful.</p>

      <p class="">Home to an impressive ski resort, Winterberg (there’s a clue in the name) is the premier winter-sports home in NRW & West Germany. Set in the beautiful wooded-peaks of Sauerland, this is a unique spot to spend your winter skiing down exhilarating pistes. Six ski areas and over 50km of slopes offer a vast range of winter activities, with plenty après-ski options each night. Winterberg is the finest winter-sports destination north of the Alps.</p>

      <p class=""> A fairytale landscape thick with ancient woods, the Black Forest is an iconic outdoor destination. In winter, it becomes even more beguiling, with snow-topped canopies frosting an undulating landscape of hills and peaks. Relish this landscape with cross-country skiing or a bracing winter hike, before warming up in a traditional Gasthaus for hearty fare. Lengthy pistes and speedy slopes satisfy those looking for a winter rush, with over 60km to whizz down. Don’t miss irresistibly-fun toboggan runs and romantic ice-skating in this magical landscape.</p>
